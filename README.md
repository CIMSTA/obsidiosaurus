# Introduction

Obsidiosaurus is a converter for Obsidian.md (https://obsidian.md/) notes to the static site builder Docusaurus (https://docusaurus.io/)
  
It allows for a better exeperience writing and maintaining the markdownfiles, since both share alot of common featues.

Currently its heavily in WIP and with manual steps, but goal is to automate this workflow as good as possible.
